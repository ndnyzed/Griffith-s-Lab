# Griffith-s-Lab
I am trying to make a simple drag and drop virtual lab.  I want to be able to drop an image on another and to change the dropped image to something new.  i.e.  have a picture of an empty needle, drop it on a mouse and then have the needle full of blood.  I want to go beyond this, but I want to be able to execute this first part.
